Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It involves storing solutions to these subproblems so that they can be reused later, which helps in avoiding redundant calculations. By efficiently solving smaller subproblems and combining their solutions, Dynamic Programming enables faster and more optimized solutions for a variety of problems, such as optimization, sequence alignment, and graph traversal.
